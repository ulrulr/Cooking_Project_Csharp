# Cooking_Project_Csharp
Cooking Project in C#

The aim of this project is to create an interface specific to the catering industry, which allows customers to place orders.
The application proposes dishes directly and is in direct contact with suppliers. There is an interface that allows customers 
to register on the supplier side to order ingredients that are missing automatically.
Customers can also become cooks and propose recipes to the application. There is also a currency for the application.
